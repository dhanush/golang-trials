Running `go run Web.go` will create a simple http server listening on port 8080.

http://localhost:8080/ will show you a HTML form where you can enter an ID and Name of a Product. All the entered data, which are held in memory, are showed on click of submit as a JSON object.

This is based on the SimpleRest.go code.
